# Clicky Game

## Overview
1. This is a memory game created using React. The application's UI is divided into components and responds to user events.
2. The application renders 16 different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
3. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented each time an different image is clicked on. The score is reset to 0 if the same image is clicked on more than once.
4. Images shuffle in a random order after each click.
5. The game restarts and the user's score is reset to zero after an incorrect guess. But the high est achieved score remains.
